            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:184585:166"/> begin firſt with my Innocence, and introth I think it not very needfull for me to inſiſt long upon this, for all the <hi>world</hi> knows that I never did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a war with the two houſes of Parliam. and I call God to witneſſe to whom I muſt ſhortly make an account, that I never did intend to incroach upon their priviledges. They began upon mine. It was the Militia they began upon. They confeſſed that the Militia was mine, but they thought it fit for to have it from me; And to be ſhort, if any body will look into the Dates of the Commiſſions, of their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and mine, and likewiſe to the Declarations, he will ſee clearly that they began theſe unhappy troubles, not I; So that as for the guilt of theſe enormous crimes that are laid againſt me, I do hope that God will clear me of it. I will not (for I am in charity) and God forbid that I ſhould lay it upon the two ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:184585:167"/> inſtruments betwixt them and me, have been the chief Cauſe of all this bloodſhed, ſo that, as I finde my ſelf clear of this, I hope and pray to God that they may alſo. Yet for all this, God forbid, that I ſhould be ſo evil a Chriſtian as not to ſay, that Gods judgement are juſt upon me. Many times he doth pay Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by an unjuſt ſentence, that is ordinary. I will onely ſay this, that an unjuſt ſentence that I ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take effect, is now puniſhed by an unjuſt ſentence upon me; So far I have ſaid to ſhew you how that I am an innocent man. Now for to ſhew you that <hi>I</hi> am a good Chriſtian <hi>I</hi> hope (poynting to Doctor <hi>Iuxon)</hi> there is good man will bear me witneſs, that <hi>I</hi> have forgiven all the world, and even thoſe in particular, who have been the chief cauſers of my death, who they are God knowes, <hi>I</hi> do not deſire to know, <hi>I</hi> pray God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them. But this is not all. My charity muſt go further, <hi>I</hi> wiſh that they may repent, for indeed they
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:184585:167"/> have committed a great ſin in that particular, I pray to God with Saint <hi>Steven, That this be not laid to their charge,</hi> and withall that they may take the right way to the peace of the kingdom, for my charity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me, not onely to forgive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, but to indeavour to the laſt Gaſpe the peace, and happineſs of the Kingdom; So ſirs I do wiſh with all my ſoul, that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>Now ſirs I muſt ſhew you both how you are out of the way, and put you in a way. Firſt, you are out of the way; for certainly all the way that you ever had yet, as far a I could find by any thing, is in the way of conqueſt: Certainly this is an evil way, for conqueſt in my opinion is never juſt, except there be a good and a juſt cauſe, either for matter of wrong or a juſt title; and then if you go beyond the firſt quarrell that you have, that makes it unjuſt in the end that was juſt at firſt; for if there be onely matter of conqueſt, then it is
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:184585:168"/> a great robbery, as a Pirate ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was the great Robber, himſelfe was but a petty Robber; and ſo Sirs, I doe thinke, for the way you are in you are much out of the way. Now ſirs, for to put you in the way, believe it, you wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go right, nor wil <hi>God</hi> ever proſper you, untill you give God his due, the King his due, that is, my ſucceſſor, and the people their due; I am as much for them, and more then any of you; you muſt give God his due by regulating rightly his Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcripture, which is now out of order, and to ſet you in a way particularly now I cannot, but onely a Nationall Synod freely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, freely debating among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt ſettle this, when every opinion is freely and clearly heard; For the King indeed I will not, the Laws of the Land will clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you for that, therefore becauſe it concerns my own particular, I do onely give you a touch of it. For the people I do truly deſire their liberty and freedome as much as any body whoſoever; but I muſt tell you, that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:184585:168"/> their liberty and their freedom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in having government under thoſe laws by which they live, and their goods may be moſt their own, it is not in having a ſhare in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that is nothing pertaining to them. A Soveraign and a Subject are clean different things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore untill you do that, <hi>I</hi> mean, that you do put the people into that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which <hi>I</hi> ſpeak of, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver certainly enjoy themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Sirs, it was for this that I am hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come, for if I would have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en way to an arbitrary power, that is, to have all laws changed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the power of the ſword, I needed not to have come here, and therefore I tell you, and I pray to God it be not laid to your charge that I am the Martyr of the people. Introth ſirs, I ſhould not hold you any longer, I will onely ſay this to you, that I could have deſired ſome little time longer, becauſe I would put this which I have ſaid in a little better order, and have had it a little better digeſted then I have now
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:184585:169"/> done, and therefore I hope you will excuſe me, I have now delivered my conſcience, and I pray God you take thoſe courſes that are beſt for the good of the kingdome, and your own ſalvations.</p>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:184585:169"/> God, <hi>I</hi> will ſay no more. On this the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſaid unto him, There is but one ſtage more; this ſtage is full of noiſe and tumult, it is but a ſhort one, but you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it will ſoon carry you from earth to heaven, and there you will find an abundance of unrepented joy and comfort. To this the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>I</hi> paſſe from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where there is no diſturbance, no diſturbance in the world. The Biſhop melting into tears, aſſured him that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed from a temporall to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall crown: a good exchange. After this, the King putting his hair under his cap, after ſome ſhort and fervent ejaculations in private, with his hands and eyes lift up to heaven, immediately ſtooped down and laid his neck upon the block, and the King perceiving the Executioner prepared and armed to give the fatal blow, ſaid unto him, <hi>Stay for the ſigne:</hi> and after a very little pauſe, ſtretching forth his hands, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner at one blow ſevered his head
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:184585:170"/> from his body: and even his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies wept in private for what they had done in publick.</p>
                  <p>His body was put into a coffin co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with black velvet, and carried from thence to his houſe at Saint <hi>Iamſes,</hi> where being embalmed and wrapped up in a ſheet of lead, it was expoſed to the view of the people.</p>
                  <p>On Wedneſday the 7 of Feb. his body was delivered to two of his ſervants to be buried at <hi>Windſor,</hi> where the next day the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Lindſey</hi> and <hi>Southampton</hi> repaired, and buried him in a vault in St. <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> Chappel, it being the ſame vault where <hi>Henry</hi> the eight had beene heretofore interred.</p>

Amongſt the Engliſh there were ſeverall hurt and killed, and it was conjectured by the wrack that two of the Holland men of warre were ſunk: the night coming on, the Engliſh made towards <hi>Plimouth</hi> to repair their veſſels, but eſpecially their maſts, yards, and tackling which were ſo torn in the fight, yet they were inforced to give over the enemy.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of September Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Blake</hi> fought with the French fleet that were carrying Auxiliaries and proviſions to the relief of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> and having maſtered them to obedience, it was the onely meanes
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:184585:173"/> that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was ſurrendred to the Spaniard.</p>
               <p>Some few dayes afterwards he diſcovered about ſixty ſaile of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land men of war, commanded by Admirall <hi>de Witte,</hi> on the backſide of the <hi>Goodwins Sands,</hi> whom he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed almoſt as far as <hi>Weſt-chappell</hi> in <hi>Zeland,</hi> and took the Admirall of the reer ſquadron.</p>
               <p>Not long afterwards there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother fight betwixt eleven of the Holland men and a ſquadron of the Engliſh in the Mediterranean ſea, where the the Engliſh being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by numbers, the <hi>Phaenix,</hi> a very gallant Frigot, of five and forty guns, was boarded by a Holland man of war, and inforced to yeild.</p>
               <p>On the ninteenth of September a part of the Engliſh fleet ſet ſaile for <hi>Denmark,</hi> to demand the Engliſh ſhips that were there detained, and whoſe lading was carried on ſhore and ſold. This Ambaſſage was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and no reſtauration made until many moneths afterwards: coming home the <hi>Antelop</hi> Frigot being Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:184585:174"/> commanded by Captain <hi>Ball,</hi> ſteering too much to the ſhore, did run upon the ſands, where ſhe was loſt, and it was ten to one that the whole Fleet had not followed her, ſhe bearing the lanthorn. She was an excellent Frigot, and carried fifty braſs guns.</p>
               <p>Not long afterwards the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders came forth to ſea againe with fourſcore ſhips and upwards, againſt whom the Engliſh Fleet, under the command of Gen. <hi>Blake,</hi> advanced; it is ſaid they conſiſted not of above two and forty ſhips, and that not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half of them ingaged in that dayes ſervice, and bare the brunt of the puiſſant Holland Fleet. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-guard</hi> and the <hi>Victory,</hi> two brave Frigots, having been that whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon ingaged in the midſt of the enemy, who fired from all ſides on them, got off in a very good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Garland, a frigot that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forty pieces of Canon, was boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and being over-powred on all ſides, was inforced to yeild; the <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> a gallant ſhip, going to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:184585:174"/> relieve the Garland, did fall alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the enemies. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Blake,</hi> who commanded the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph plunging into the midſt of his enemies to fetch off the Garland and Bonaventure, was clapt on board by the Dutch, and had his fore-maſt ſhot down cloſe to the board; but having ſtoutly defended himſelfe, he at length got cleare, and went off with the reſt of the Fleet.</p>
               <p>But on the latter end of February 1653. the Engliſh did put forth to ſea again with a gallant fleet, Gen. <hi>Blake</hi> in the <hi>Triumph</hi> followed by Gen. <hi>Dean,</hi> having diſcovered 80. Holl. men of War (who ſeemed to out-dare them between the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> and <hi>Portland)</hi> began the fight; the Engliſh Fleet came not up unto their Generall, who all the morning had been engaged untill two in the afternoon, at what time there was a moſt cruell fight, which continued till dark night. The Engliſh loſt the Sampſon, which was ſo leaky and ſo unſerviceable, that the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers ſunk her themſelves after
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:184585:175"/> they had taken her. On the next day and the day following the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh again aſſaulted the Hollanders; on the laſt day the fight was more obſtinate then the former. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh in this fight took about nine men of War, and fifty Merchants ſhips, and ſunk ſeverall other ſhips; fifteen hundred priſoners were brought up to <hi>London.</hi> Gen. <hi>Blake</hi> was hurt in this incounter, having done as much as could be expected from a gallant ſeaman, and many of his captains and officers, who were men of great courage, were both hurt and killed in this deſperate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. In this ſpring the Engliſh loſt ſome ſhips at <hi>Legorne,</hi> captaine <hi>Badily</hi> who commanded a ſquadron of nine men of War, being not able by the averſeneſs of the wind to come up and aſſiſt captain <hi>Appleton,</hi> whoſe Frigots not equal to the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers were ſurrounded by them. There were loſt in this fight the Leopard and Smugge Frigot, which carried fifty pieces of canon; ſhe was boarded &amp; taken by the Dutch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:184585:175"/> and for the ſpace of five hours maintained a ſtout fight with him and two other great ſhips. At the ſame time the Bonaventure, a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant frigot of the Engliſh was blown up, an iron bullet from the enemy having unhappily fired the powder. The Pilgrim was alſo taken, having her main and mizen maſts both ſhot down. The Levant Merchant ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtout Engliſh frigot was taken. The Sampſon being aſſaulted by young <hi>Van-trump,</hi> and a fire-ſhip of the Hollanders, was ſoon ſet on fire, and periſhed in the ſea.</p>
               <p>Not long afterward Gen. <hi>Cromwel</hi> alledging that the drifts of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were to eſtabliſh themſelves in a perpetuall Senate, which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the ambition of his ſpirit, which deſired predominant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, he found the meanes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the long Parliament, which very few ſeemed to be grieved at; and that all the world might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the reaſons wherefore he did it, he publiſhed his <hi>Manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p> A Council of State was preſently ſetled, and not long afterwards there was another great fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Engliſh and the Dutch, which continued for the ſpace of two dayes: in this fight the Engliſh loſt Gen. <hi>Dean</hi> one of their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, who was taken off by a great ſhot in the firſt days ingagement: there were ſlain of the Engliſh (as the liſts then gave account) one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and threeſcore men, and two hundred and forty hurt; of the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers one thouſand and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were taken priſoners, and ſix men of war were ſunk; the Engliſh purſued their victory to the very mouth of the Texell, and blocked up the Hollanders in their own ports.</p>
               <p>In the mean time on the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of July Gen. <hi>Cromwell</hi> called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Parliament, which by reaſon of the ſudden and unexpected diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of it, was called the ſhort Parliament.</p>
               <p>On the latter end of this moneth there was a memorable fight betwixt
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:184585:176"/> the Dutch and the Engliſh, during the time of a treaty betwixt both Nations, this battel was fought with admirable reſolution on both ſides. The fight began in the evening, which though but ſhort was very ſmart. The Dutch in the night-time being recruited with five and twenty gallant ſhips, did fall of themſelves the next morning on the Engliſh fleet with a great deal of gallantry and reſolution. In this fight Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Van-trump</hi> was ſlain: there were twenty men of War of the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſunk or burnt in this fight. Of the Engliſh there were ſlaine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right eight Captains, and five hurt: the <hi>Triumph</hi> and the <hi>Andrew,</hi> two Frigots, were ſorely put to it, and received great dammage in their ſails and rigging. The Hollanders ſeeing ſo great a number of their ſhips loſt did face about, and did bear away with al the ſail they could make unto the Texell and the Engl. not judging it expedient to ingage too far upon them, did ſet ſaile with the whole Fleet towards <hi>Yarmouth,</hi>

The flatteries of the people did ſeem to promiſe a long continuance to his regency, for from the firſt week of his Protectorſhip, almoſt to the laſt, there were nothing but gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from one place or another to

               <p>There being at the ſame time, many Members of the ſame Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in <hi>London,</hi> and ſome of them in the Hall, they endeavoured to go up into the Houſe, but were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Souldery; amongſt theſe Members was Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> who being of a high ſpirit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at it, did ſpeak ſome words very haſtily, which as raſhly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he did put in practiſe.</p>
               <p>The Parliament removed Col. <hi>Berkstead,</hi> from being Leiutenant of the Tower, many Petitions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints being preferred againſt him, and Col. <hi>Fitz</hi> was choſen to ſupply his place.</p>
